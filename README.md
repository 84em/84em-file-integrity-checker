## WP-CLI Commands

The plugin provides comprehensive CLI support for automation and scripting.

### Running Scans

```bash

wp 84em integrity scan

# Run with specific type
wp 84em integrity scan --type=scheduled

# Output in different formats
wp 84em integrity scan --format=json
```

### Viewing Results

```bash
# List recent scan results
wp 84em integrity results

# View specific scan details
wp 84em integrity results 123
```

### Managing Schedules

```bash
# List all schedules
wp 84em integrity schedules list

# Create a new schedule
wp 84em integrity schedules create \
  --name="Daily Scan" \
  --frequency=daily \
  --time=02:00 \
  --active

# Enable/disable schedules
wp 84em integrity schedules enable --id=1
wp 84em integrity schedules disable --id=1

# Delete a schedule
wp 84em integrity schedules delete --id=1

# Recalculate all schedule next run times
wp 84em integrity recalculate_schedules
```

### Configuration Management

```bash
# List all settings
wp 84em integrity config list

# Get specific setting
wp 84em integrity config get notification_email

# Update settings
wp 84em integrity config set notification_email admin@example.com
wp 84em integrity config set max_file_size 10485760
```

## Usage Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Activate the plugin** - Database tables are created automatically
2. **Configure settings** - Set file types and exclusions
3. **Run initial scan** - Establish baseline checksums
4. **Create schedules** - Set up automated scanning
5. **Configure notifications** - Get alerts for changes

### Monitoring Workflow

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Check the dashboard widget for quick status
2. **Review Changes**: When changes are detected, review the scan details
3. **View Diffs**: See the pre-generated diffs for modified files
4. **Investigate**: Determine if changes are authorized
5. **Take Action**: Address any unauthorized modifications
6. **Document**: Keep notes on legitimate changes
7. **Manage History**: Use bulk operations to clean up old scan results

### Best Practices

- **Regular Scans**: Schedule daily scans during low-traffic periods
- **Baseline After Updates**: Run manual scan after plugin/theme updates
- **Monitor Critical Files**: Focus on PHP files in wp-admin and wp-includes
- **Retention Policy**: Keep 30-90 days of history for compliance
- **Email Alerts**: Configure notifications for production sites
- **Exclude Dynamic**: Skip cache, uploads, and backup directories

## Database Schema

The plugin creates five custom tables:

### eightyfourem_integrity_scan_results
Stores scan metadata and statistics including scan duration, memory usage, and type

### eightyfourem_integrity_file_records
Contains individual file checksums, change tracking, pre-generated diff content, and sensitive file flags

### eightyfourem_integrity_scan_schedules
Manages multiple scan schedules with configurations and Action Scheduler integration

### eightyfourem_integrity_checksum_cache
Temporary cache for file content (48-hour TTL) used during diff generation at scan time

### eightyfourem_integrity_logs
System activity logging with levels (debug, info, warning, error), contexts, and user tracking

## Security Considerations

- **Capability Checks**: All admin actions require `manage_options` capability
- **Nonce Verification**: CSRF protection on all forms and AJAX endpoints
- **Data Sanitization**: Input validation and output escaping
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prepared statements for all queries
- **File Access Validation**: Path traversal prevention and sensitive file protection
- **Sensitive File Protection**: No content storage or diffs for wp-config.php, .env, keys, etc.

## Performance

- **Batch Processing**: Handles large file sets efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Streaming for large files
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for fast retrieval
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during scans via AJAX
- **Configurable Limits**: Set max file size to skip large files
- **Efficient Diff Generation**: Diffs generated at scan time, not on-demand
- **Temporary Cache**: 48-hour content cache with automatic cleanup
- **Background Processing**: Uses Action Scheduler for non-blocking operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Action Scheduler not available"**
- Install WooCommerce or Action Scheduler plugin
- Scheduling features require Action Scheduler library

**Scan times out**
- Increase PHP max_execution_time
- Reduce max file size setting
- Add more directories to exclusion list

**Memory errors**
- Increase PHP memory_limit
- Exclude large directories like uploads
- Reduce file size limit

**No changes detected**
- Verify file permissions are readable
- Check excluded directories settings
- Ensure scan completed successfully

### Debug Mode

Enable WordPress debug mode for detailed logging:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
```

Check logs at: `wp-content/debug.log`
